Application for managing "Virtual Desktop Infrastructure"  for Remote Teams.

Teams working remotely require hosts or servers for doing their development work as well for testing and production. Often configurtion of this servers is pre-determined based on environment. This application helped remote teams manage these servers on AWS. Teams need not be given access to AWS. Instead they should create servers for their use from this app. This helped better management of cloud infrastructure and also control the cost as who can use which server can be controlled.
